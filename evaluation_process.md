To help you in your proposal rating duties, here are a set of suggestions towards the process.

We recommend that you read each submission twice. 

On your first pass of a submission, think about:

- Who is this for?
- Why do they care?
- What are the learning outcomes?

On the second pass, think about:

- Does the title sell the submission?
- Are the 3 points interesting and relevant to the subject?
- Does the scope match the intended targeted audience?
- Is the topic timely? New take on a subject? Unique?

Be careful to remember that everyone has a unique voice, and just because you might not agree with someone doesn’t mean that they shouldn’t have the opportunity to share their experience. Pairing to evaluate a proposal is encouraged!
